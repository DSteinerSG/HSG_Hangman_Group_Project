# Asking the player to enter his/her name and greet him/her

# Hangman rules explanation
tutorial = "Hello" + " " + name + "," + " " + """welcome to the game Hangman. Hangman is a game where you have to 
guess a secret word by suggesting letters. The only thing you know in advance is the number of letters of the word 
you are looking for. This is represented by the number of underscores. If you guess a correct letter, the underscore will be 
replaced by the correct letter at the appropriate position. If your suggested letter is wrong and not 
present in the hidden word, this counts as a miss.

This game can be played both casually for a single round and competitively, where you have to win 3 rounds on the same 
level of difficulty to win a unique certificate. There are three different levels of difficulty, 
differing by the number of allowed misses. In the easy level you have a total of 8 misses, 
in the medium level 6 and in the difficult level 4. If you manage to correctly guess the word with fewer misses, 
you win. Otherwise you lose. Good luck!"""
