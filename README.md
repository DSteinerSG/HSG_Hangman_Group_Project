# HSG_Group_Project
This is a project for the HSG Programming Group assignment.

The group project focuses on creating a simple text-based implementation of the classic word-guessing game known as HANGMAN. Players have to guess a secret word by inputting individual letters within a limited number of attempts. The number of attempts depend on the difficulty level chosen by each player. If a player decides to play competitevely he is able to earn a certificate if he correctly guesses three words in a row.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.XX 
Python environment must be allowed to read and write files

## Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

## Playing
To start the Hangman game, run the following command: python hangman.py
Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to play the game. Enter a letter to make a guess, and press Enter to submit your guess. The game will provide feedback on whether the letter is correct or incorrect.
You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly. If you guess all the letters correctly before running out of attempts, you win the game. If you exceed the maximum number of attempts without guessing the word, you lose.

Enjoy playing Hangman!
